## This test is completed in approx 2.5 hours. This is the demo application, hence limited validation added and focus mainly on happy path scenarios.

## Due to the time constraint certain unit tests are not added. Also code comments were not added.

## The h2database is added as it is memory database and dose not required addional efforts.

### Building

The test can be built with

    mvn clean install


Build the project:

    mvn clean package
    mvn spring-boot:run 

The application exposes the following rest URLs:

- GET on `http://localhost:8080/customers`:  To getting all customers data.

- POST on `http://localhost:8080/customers` :  Add Customer

    curl -w "\n" -X POST http://localhost:8080/customers

    media type - application/json
    payload
       {

           "firstName": "Dinesh",
           "lastName": "Kadam"

       }

Note: The Id value is generated by the system.


- DELETE

    http://localhost:8080/customers/[customer ID]


The integration tests are added using Spring MVC mock framework. We can add more test scenarios there.
